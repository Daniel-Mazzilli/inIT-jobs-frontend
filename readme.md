### inIT Jobs

inIT jobs was designed and developed with the focus to connect recent college and bootcamp graduates to their first tech role. The jobs posted are specifically intended for people who are looking to get their first professional experience in the tech field.

The app is mobile first designed, desktop view is among future implementations.

To get started, register as an applicant or as a recruiter. Recruiter registration requires an invitation code. If you are a recruiter reach out, and I will be gladly happy to share the invitation key.

Once your account is set up, if you are an applicant you may apply to positions. On the other hand as a recruiter you may submit job posting and keep track of the people who applied.
